code . this is used to open the folder in visual studio
create a virtual environment called venv_name

The command below will create a new folder called venv_name

python -m venv venv_name

NOTE: the virtual environment name can be anything (like banana). However, it is common practice to use just venv. This is handy when copying/pasting code snippets.

Hence, use the following command:

  python -m venv venv
NOTE: a message will appear (bottom right) asking to use the new environment, click 'Yes'.

Alternatively, choose from the list of environments (bottom left). The Python version should be listed with venv in parentheses, e.g.
 Python 3.9.1 64-bit ('venv')

 use the following command source .venv/bin/activate

 now run the file using 
python main.py
